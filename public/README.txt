This directory contains static files served by the application.

For a real implementation, you should include:
- demo-audio.mp3: A sample audio file for demonstration purposes
- icons and other visual assets

In a production environment, audio files would typically be stored in a proper
cloud storage service rather than in the public directory of the application.
